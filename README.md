This folder holds the information for the 2025 Control System for Stevens Electric Boatworks.

This is still very much a WIP, and everything is subject to change.

The current codebase is stored at ~


## FAQ

#### How is this different from the 2017-2024 Control System?

This year differs because we decided to redo the control system for a variety of reasons:

* The old seniors who knew the code graduated, and left behind a system that is hard to understand
* The new control system will be more modular, and will allow us to be able to add components to the boat more easily
